## About Me
Welcome. My name is Andrew Boryk, and I am an iOS Developer and Entrepreneur. I began coding when I was 12, which is a skill I’ve continued to practice for the past 9 years. My relationship with developing iPhone apps originated in my senior year of high school. It's been 5 years since then, and I’ve continued to teach myself iOS development, while graduating college with an Accounting degree. I’ve published several arcade games, three social media apps, and an app for our college’s newspaper. My most recent venture was a college social media named Tapt, where I was the Co-founder, Chief Technology Officer, and Lead iOS developer.

Currently I’m looking for an opportunity to contribute my skills as an iOS developer employed full-time or under contract.

## Projects

I have a number of projects that I have worked on, and I've deployed over a dozen applications to the App Store. Some projects I would like to make note of are:

* [Tapt](http://www.tapt.io): Tapt was a College student-only social media. I was Co-founder, CTO, and the Lead Developer of the [iOS Application](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tapt-exclusive-campus-feed/id982739793?mt=8). 

* [Land That Rocket!](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/land-that-rocket!/id1042046100?mt=8): A fun and challenging game that was imagined, designed, and built within a 24-hour time frame. 

* [ABMediaView](https://github.com/AndrewBoryk/ABMediaView): A library I built for drop-in image, video, GIF and audio display and lazy-loading functionality. ABMediaView which subclasses UIImageView, and has functionality to minimize from fullscreen, as well as show GIF previews for videos.

* [ABVolumeControl](https://github.com/AndrewBoryk/ABVolumeControl): A custom volume control that replaces MPVolumeView, with multiple styles available, and a delegate to implement one's own custom volume view.

* [ABUtils](https://github.com/AndrewBoryk/ABUtils): A Utils library I built that can be used in any iOS project, to reduce the amount of repetitive code by providing users with useful pre-written functions.

* [ABKeyboardAccessory](https://github.com/AndrewBoryk/ABKeyboardAccessory): A library which can be used as an inputAccessory to a UITextField or UITextView, and relays whether the keyboard has been shown or has disappeared for the field/view.
