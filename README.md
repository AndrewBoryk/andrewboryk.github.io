## About Me
Welcome. My name is Andrew Boryk, and I am an iOS Developer and Entrepreneur. I began coding when I was 12, which is a skill I’ve continued to practice for the past 9 years. My relationship with developing iPhone apps originated in my senior year of high school. It's been 5 years since then, and I’ve continued to teach myself iOS development, while graduating college with an Accounting degree. I’ve published several arcade games, three social media apps, and an app for our college’s newspaper. My most recent venture was a college social media named Tapt, where I was the Co-founder, Chief Technology Officer, and Lead iOS developer.

Currently I’m looking for an opportunity to contribute my skills as an iOS developer employed full-time or under contract.

## Projects

I have a number of projects that I have worked on, and I've deployed over a dozen applications to the App Store. Some projects I would like to make note of are:

* [Tapt](http://www.tapt.io): I was Co-founder, CTO, and the Lead Developer of the [iOS Application](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tapt-exclusive-campus-feed/id982739793?mt=8)

* [ABMediaView](https://andrewboryk.github.io/ABMediaView/): A library I built for drop-in image, video, and GIF display and lazy-loading functionality. As well as the functionality to minimize the view from fullscreen.

* [ABUtils](https://www.github.com/andrewboryk/ABUtils): A Utils library I built that can be used in any iOS project, to reduce the amount of repetitive code by providing users with useful pre-written functions.
